Random number generator seed: 3


WARNING: The treefile contained partion lengths but only one partition
was specified.
Simulations of 4 taxa, 160 nucleotides
  for 3 tree(s) with 1 dataset(s) per tree

Branch lengths assumed to be number of substitutions per site

Codon position rate heterogeneity:
    rates = 1:0.400000 2:0.400000 3:0.400000
Model = HKY: Hasegawa, Kishino & Yano (1985)
  Rate of transitions and transversions equal:
  transition/transversion ratio = 0.5 (K=1)
  with nucleotide frequencies equal.
