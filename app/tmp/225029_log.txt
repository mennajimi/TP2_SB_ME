Random number generator seed: 2078359095362172162

Simulations of 4 taxa, 10 nucleotides
  for 1 tree(s) with 10 dataset(s) per tree

Branch lengths assumed to be number of substitutions per site

Discrete gamma rate heterogeneity:
    shape = 1.000000, 2 categories
Invariable sites model:
    proportion invariable = 0.000000
Model = F84: Felsenstein (1984)
  Rate of transitions and transversions equal:
  transition/transversion ratio = 0.5 (kappa=0)
  with nucleotide frequencies equal.
