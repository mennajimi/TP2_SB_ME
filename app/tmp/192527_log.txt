Random number generator seed: -647467454201505524

Simulations of 4 taxa, 100 nucleotides
  for 1 tree(s) with 1 dataset(s) per tree

Branch lengths assumed to be number of substitutions per site

Rate homogeneity of sites.
Model = HKY: Hasegawa, Kishino & Yano (1985)
  Rate of transitions and transversions equal:
  transition/transversion ratio = 0.5 (K=1)
  with nucleotide frequencies specified as:
  A=0.2 C=0.2 G=0.2 T=0.2

Time taken: 0.001062 seconds
